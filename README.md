# ReadSTL
Using WSL and VS Code to read stl files
There seems to be a bug with VS Code 1.50.1 . I defined my prelaunchTask `preLaunchTask": "C/C++: g++ build active file",` but this is never called first. Manually running the prelaunch Terminal/Build Run Task works just fine. I am able to create `main`
